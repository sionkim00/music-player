# Music Player

## Live Preview (Codesandbox)

## Concept
I personally enjoy listening to musics as much as I like to code! While I was listening to Spotify, I came up with an idea of building a music player of my own.
2 Main features of this application:
 - Player Control
 - Music Libraries
## Stacks
 - React
 - SCSS
## ðŸ–¥ Developments
**Modularize common components**
Components such as Player and Song used in the service are modularized and developed for general use.
**State managements**
Since this application has only 2 levels of component depth, React hooks were used to manage the state.
